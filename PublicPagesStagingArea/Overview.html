<h1 style="text-align: center;">XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 Test Suite</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The XQuery and XPath Full Text 1.0 Test Suite (XQFTTS) provides a set of metrics for determining
whether <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-full-text-10/">XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0</a>
can be implemented interoperably as published. XQFTTS will help implementers
identify possible problems both with the Specification and with their
software. The test suite is occasionally updated to reflect the current work
of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query">W3C XML Query Working Group</a>
and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">W3C XSL Working Group</a>. All
releases of the XQFTTS will be available from this page.</p>

<p>The XQFTTS contains over 400 test cases. It contains a catalog that
contains general information on the test suite, as well as test descriptions
for each of the test cases included in this release. Test queries and
expected results are contained in individual files. All interpretations of
this Candidate Recommendation are subject to confirmation by the XML Query Working
Group and the XSL Working Group.</p>

<p>Implementors are encouraged 1) to write a harness for this test suite and
to test their implementations, 2) to report their results to the XML Query
and XSL Working Groups, and 3) to submit test cases to the XML Query and XSL Working Groups to
help us complete our coverage of XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0. All of these areas are
discussed in greater detail below.</p>

<p>This document serves as a first point of information for all interested
parties. A general account of current activities, finalized work, and
pointers to further information is given. In the sections below, you will be
able to get a good view of the status of the XQFTTS, and if you are interested
in something in particular you are invited to follow the appropriate link
given below.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>The XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0 specification has been published as a Candidate Recommentation on 2008-05-16.</p>

<p>XQFTTS 0.8.0 provides an early look at this test suite. It contains about
90% of the tests that will exist when the test suite has been completed (except for tests expressed in XQuery's XML syntax, XQueryX). We
encourage implementors to build their test harnesses and to provide feedback
to the XML Query and XSL Working Groups.</p>

<p>XQFTTS 0.8.0 contains no Full Text XQueryX test cases. We expect to
have a Full Text XQueryX test case that corresponds to each Full Text test case that is
not identified as a parse error when the XQFTTS is complete. </p>
<p>It will take us some time to complete this test suite. We encourage
  members of the public to contribute tests in some <a
href="ContributionAreas.html">specific areas</a>. The submission of test
  cases is discussed below.</p>

<p>This zip file contain a large number of files, including XQFTTSCatalog.xml,
a catalog file contain the metadata for the test suite, files that contain
source documents, files that contain queries, and files that contain expected
query results. These files also contain a description of the XML document
that implementors should produce, if they wish to submit their results to us.
The release_notes.html file helps determine what has changed from one release of the XQFTTS to the next.</p>

<p>We have associated a stylesheet with XQFTTSCatalog.xml to make the test
suite metadata more readable.</p>

<h1>Running the Test Suite</h1>

<p>We encourage you, the implementors of XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0, to run these
tests and send us your results. These results will help us exit Candidate
Recommendation (described in the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">Process Document</a>).</p>

<p>As there is no <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em> API for implementations of XQuery 1.0,
we are not able to provide a test harness to execute these tests. You will
have to write your own test harnesses.</p>

<p>We have provided <a
href="GuidelinesForRunningTheFul TextTestSuite.html">Guidelines
for Running the XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0 Test Suite</a> to assist you in running these
tests. These guidelines will tell you how the queries may be modified before
they are executed and how to compare your actual results with the expected
results that we have provided.</p>

<h2>Reporting a Problem</h2>

<p>If you believe that some of the queries or their expected results are
incorrect, then we encourage you to enter bug reports in the public instance
of Bugzilla at W3C, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/">http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/</a>. To
enter a bug report you will need a Bugzilla signon (email address and
password). You can create this signon by following the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/createaccount.cgi">Open a new Bugzilla
account</a> link on the Bugzilla Main Page.</p>

<p>General information on Bugzilla, an open-source bug tracking system, is
available at <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">http://www.bugzilla.org/</a>.
The standard documentation for the version currently being run on the W3C
server is available at <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.18/html/index.html">http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.18/html/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>To enter a bug report in Bugzilla you will need to log in, choose the
action "New", and then choose the "XPath and XQuery Full Text 1.0 Test Suite" product. Enter a short description of the problem in the Summary field; it would be very helpful if every Summary started with the string &quot;[XQFTTS]&quot;. Detailed information should be entered in the Description field. Please be
specific about the problem that you are reporting and clearly identify the test
case or test cases that are problematic. If you believe that the expected
result is wrong, then tell us what result you believe is correct. If you
believe that another result for a test case is justified, then please tell us
what it is. In both cases, please cite portions of one or more of the XPath, XQuery,
and Full Text specifications that support your position.</p>

<h1>Submission of Test Suite Results</h1>

<p>When you are ready to submit your results to us, we ask that you follow
the guidelines provided in <a
href="GuidelinesForSubmittingXQFTTSTestResults.html">Guidelines for
Submitting XPath and XQuery Full Text Test Suite Results</a>. These guidelines will tell you
how to generate an XML result document that we can use to generate our
reports. They will also tell you how to generate your own report from the XML
result file.</p>

<p>If you have indicated that you wish your results to be displayed as
&#x201c;Anonymous&#x201d;, then please send them to the XML Query WG Team
Contact, <a href="mailto:liam@w3.org">Liam Quin</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:w3t-archive@w3.org">w3t-archive@w3.org</a>. Otherwise, please
send them to the Full Text Task Force chair, <a
href="mailto:jim.melton@acm.org">Jim Melton </a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:www-archive@w3.org">www-archive@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage you to send us results early, and then to send us updates as
the FTTS progresses and as your implementation progresses.</p>

<h1>Submission of Test Cases</h1>

<p>We welcome submissions of test cases from individuals and organizations
that are not already participating in the XML Query Working Group or the XSL Working Group. We
encourage you to look at <a
href="GuidelinesForTestSubmission.html">Guidelines for XPath and XQuery
Full Text Test Suite Submissions</a> so that the test cases that you submit can be
added easily to our test suite.</p>

<p>If you would like to submit test cases, then you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register for a W3C account. You can request one through the <a
    href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/Public">Public Access Request
    Form</a>.</li>
  <li>Submit your test cases using <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/testgrants2-200409/">Grant II:
    Grant of License for Contributed Test Cases Published Outside a W3C
    Recommendation</a>. This license grant, for non-Participant test case
    Contributors, is described in <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html">Policies for
    Contribution of Test Cases to W3C</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XML Query Working Group and XSL Working Group will, at their sole
discretion, determine what tests are incorporated in the test suite.</p>

<h1>Test Suite Results</h1>

<p>We have received results for the following XQuery implementations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TO BE PROVIDED </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>We have generated both <a href="XQFTTSReportSimple.html">summary</a> and <a
href="FTTSReport.html">detail</a> reports from these results.</p>
